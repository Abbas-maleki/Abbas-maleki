- 👋 Hi, I’m @Abbas-maleki, Ph.D. reseracher @Utwente!
- 👀 I’m interested in developing AI-based, simulation-based, and optimization-based DSTs to tackle uncertainty in decision-making, and my favorite programming language is Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RL and MDP to apply them in optimization problems in Healthcare Logistics!
